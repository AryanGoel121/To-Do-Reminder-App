Designed and implemented a feature-rich to-do list web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, 
with Node.js and Express.js powering the backend infrastructure. 
The application includes a reminder functionality, which seamlessly sends date and time details to meticulously defined API endpoints. 
These endpoints facilitate smooth communication with a MongoDB database, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval. 
Additionally, a Python application harmoniously integrates with the database, providing users with desktop notifications precisely timed to their set reminders. 
This comprehensive project showcases proficiency in full-stack development, API design, and system integration.
